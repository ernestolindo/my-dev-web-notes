# **Command-line interface (CLI)**

A **command-line interface (CLI)** is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with a computer system by typing commands into a console or terminal window, rather than using a graphical interface (GUI) with buttons, icons, and menus.

## **Key Characteristics of CLI**:

- **Text-Based**: Users type commands in text form rather than clicking on icons or buttons.
- **Input and Output**: The user types a command, and the system responds by displaying text-based output in the terminal window.
- **Direct Interaction with the OS**: CLI provides direct access to the operating system and its underlying functionality, offering powerful control over the system.

## **Examples of Command-Line Interfaces**:

1. **Windows CMD (Command Prompt)**: A basic CLI used in Windows for file management and running system commands.
2. **Windows PowerShell**: A more advanced CLI in Windows that supports scripting, automation, and system management.
3. **Git Batch**:
4. **Linux Terminal**: A CLI used in Linux-based systems to interact with the system using text commands.
5. **macOS Terminal**: The CLI on macOS, which is Unix-based and shares many commands with Linux.
