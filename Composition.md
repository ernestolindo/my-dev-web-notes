### **What is Composition?**

**Composition** is a design principle in object-oriented programming where you build complex objects by combining simpler, reusable objects instead of relying solely on inheritance. It involves using **"has-a"** relationships rather than **"is-a"** relationships.

For example:

- A car **has-a** engine (composition).
- A dog **is-a** animal (inheritance).
