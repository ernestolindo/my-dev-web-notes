# **Creational Patterns**

## **Singleton Pattern**

### *Definition*

The **Singleton Pattern** is a **creational design pattern** that ensures a class has only **one instance** and provides a **global point of access** to that instance.

### *Key Characteristics*

- **One Instance**: Only one object of the class will be created throughout the application.
- **Global Access**: The instance can be accessed globally through a static method.
- **Controlled Creation**: The creation of the instance is controlled by the class itself, typically through a static method (e.g., `getInstance()`).

### *When to Use*

- When you need to ensure **one instance** of a class (e.g., for managing shared resources like database connections, logging systems, etc.).
- When the creation of an object is **expensive** or you want to avoid the overhead of creating multiple instances.

### *How to Implement*

1. **Private Constructor**: Prevents external instantiation.
2. **Static `getInstance()` Method**: Returns the **single instance** and creates it only if it doesnâ€™t already exist.
3. **Static Variable**: Stores the unique instance.
