# DOM Scripting

## Selecting HTML elements

Nowadays, the two most popular forms to select HTML elements are by using 
-    `querySelector()`: single selection
-    `querySelectorAll()`: all elements returned in an array-like structure
For most modern JavaScript applications they are recommended because they support complex CSS selectors, are easier to use and reduce the need for multiple selection methods.

## Creating HTML elements

JavaScript allows us to create dynamic HTML elements using the `createElement()` method, which has properties like `element.textContent`, `element.classList` and `element.attribute` to personalize our element. An element can be added to the document as an element's child using the `appendChild()` function.

## Events

The **window** object represents the browser's window. It includes the **document** object.  `addEventListener()` defines an event to listen to, and fires a function when the event is dispatched. The **`load`** event is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets, scripts, iframes, and images, except those that are [loaded lazily](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Lazy_loading#images_and_iframes). This is in contrast to [`DOMContentLoaded`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/DOMContentLoaded_event "DOMContentLoaded"), which is fired as soon as the page DOM has been loaded, without waiting for resources to finish loading.
