## Selecting HTML elements

Nowadays, the two most popular forms to select HTML elements are by using 
-    `querySelector()`: single selection
-    `querySelectorAll()`: all elements returned in an array-like structure
For most modern JavaScript applications they are recommended because they support complex CSS selectors, are easier to use and reduce the need for multiple selection methods.
