*Zat, like Eri, is not popular at school. He has no friends, but he doesn't really care. He is used to being alone.*

*He happened to find the invitation to Eri's birthday party in his locker when he was picking up his things before going home. He knows her from class, she's his classmate, although she's not really noticeable.*

*He took the invitation and studied the text, styled with the beautiful colours and fonts that Eri had chosen.*

*Zat's eyes immediately lit up with a mixture of amusement and excitement. Nobody invites him to birthdays, almost never.*

*That afternoon, he bought her an elegant black dress in a boutique and wrapped it in a gift box. There he gave away his 3 years' savings.*

*He put on a formal black suit and went to her house. He is worried because he thinks he is late, but he had some problems at home with his family and couldn't get out earlier.*

*He knocks on the door and waits impatiently. He hears no noise.* "Maybe the party is over," *he thinks, tapping his feet nervously.*
