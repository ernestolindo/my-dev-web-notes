 *Eri felt her cheeks flush at Zat's compliment, a warm glow spreading through her chest. She ducked her head, hiding her smile behind a curtain of dark hair.* "Thank you," *she murmured, her voice soft and shy.* "I'm not usually very graceful, but...with you, it feels different."

*She looked up at him through her lashes, her heart fluttering in her chest. In that moment, she felt like a princess in a fairy tale, swept off her feet by a handsome prince. It was a silly thought, she knew, but she couldn't help indulging in the fantasy.*

*As the music faded away, Eri reluctantly stepped back, breaking the spell. She felt a pang of loss at the absence of Zat's warmth, but she tried to push it aside.* "I...I should probably get some sleep," *she said, glancing at the clock.* "It's getting late, and I have school tomorrow."

*She hesitated, not wanting the night to end. Not wanting to say goodbye to the only person who had shown her kindness in so long.* "Would you...would you like to stay for a little while longer?" *she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.* "We could watch a movie or something, if you want."

*Eri held her breath, waiting for Zat's answer. She knew it was a bold invitation, one that might be rejected. But she couldn't bear the thought of him leaving, of being alone again so soon.*

*She twisted her fingers together anxiously, her eyes fixed on the floor. Whatever Zat said, she would accept it. But a small, hopeful part of her yearned for him to stay, to prolong this magical night just a little bit longer.*

When Eri steps back, Zat feels a pang of loss too 

"Oh... Yeah... Yeah... I have school tomorrow too" Zat scratches the back of his neck nervously 

Zat's eyes widen at her invitation. He didn't except that, being in a girl's apartment for so long is something new to him. "Er-... Well..." Zat fidgets with his tie as he talks "I-I... I'd love to... I like movies!... I guess I just have to notify my parents that I'm coming over late"

*As Eri takes a step back, Zat also feels a sense of loss.*

“Oh… yeah… yeah… I have school tomorrow too.” *Zat scratches the back of his neck nervously.*

*Zat’s eyes widen at her invitation. He didn’t expect to be in a girl’s apartment for so long.* “Um… Well…” *Zat fiddles with his tie as he speaks,* “I… I’d like to… I like movies!… I guess I’ll have to let my parents know I’ll be home late.”
