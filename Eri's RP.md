Zat could tell how tired Eri was. Her kindness made his heart melt. 

"You're welcome Eri.... You are very nice to me... I don't know if I deserve that... But thank you very much" Zat smiles back at Eri, his expression showing his bare feelings for her

Zat steps out of her apartment. "See you tomorrow ma'am, sleep tightly!" He leans over as a farewell.
