Zat arrives home and goes up to his bedroom. He slumps on his bed and thinks about Eri with an smile on his lips. "She is amazing..." He says to himself

The next day at school.

Zat is on class but his mind is distracted. He can't wait for his meeting with Eri at lunch.

When the bell rings Zat runs out of the classroom and goes to Eri's classroom. He waits for her sitting on a bench.
