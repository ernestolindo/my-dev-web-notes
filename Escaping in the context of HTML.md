**Definition**: Escaping refers to the process of converting special characters in a string into a format that can be safely displayed in HTML. This prevents the browser from interpreting these characters as HTML code, which could lead to rendering errors or security vulnerabilities.

### Key Points about Escaping:

1. **Special Characters**:
    
    - Certain characters have special meanings in HTML. For example:
        - `<` (less than) is used to start a tag.
        - `>` (greater than) is used to end a tag.
        - `&` (ampersand) is used to define entities.
        - `"` (double quote) and `'` (single quote) are used to define attribute values.
2. **HTML Entities**:
    
    - When escaping, these special characters are replaced with their corresponding HTML entities:
        - `&lt;` for `<`
        - `&gt;` for `>`
        - `&amp;` for `&`
        - `&quot;` for `"`
        - `&apos;` for `'`
3. **Purpose of Escaping**:
    
    - **Preventing Errors**: If a user inputs text that includes special characters, escaping ensures that this text is displayed correctly in the browser without breaking the HTML structure.
    - **Enhancing Security**: Escaping user input helps prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, where an attacker could inject malicious scripts into a web application.
