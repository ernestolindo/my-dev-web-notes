# Diagrams

A diagram is a symbolic representation of information that uses visualization techniques to explain various concepts. Diagrams are often simple drawings that illustrate the arrangement and relationships of parts, making them useful for understanding how things work.

## **What is software development?**

Software development is ==the process of creating, designing, deploying, and supporting software==. Software is a set of instructions that tell a computer what to do.

### *Stages of software development*

The stages of software development are typically part of the [[Software Development Life Cycle]] (SDLC) and include:

- **Planning**: The project manager considers the client's needs and puts together a development team. 
- **Requirements analysis**: Also known as requirements engineering, this is the process of gathering requirements from stakeholders. A software requirement specification (SRS) is created to define requirements, get approval, and set expectations. 
- **Design**: The design phase of the SDLC. 
- **Coding**: Also known as implementation, this is the coding phase of the SDLC. 
- **Testing**: Testing is incorporated into multiple phases of the SDLC to ensure the software's quality and functionality. 
- **Deployment**: The deployment stage of the SDLC. 
- **Maintenance**: The maintenance phase of the SDLC.
