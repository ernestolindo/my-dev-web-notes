# **High-level module**

A [[module]] is a self-contained part of a program that performs a specific task or set of tasks. In object-oriented programming a module could be a class or a set of related classes.

High-level modules:

- Represent the **core [[Business logic]]** or **main functionality** of the application.
- Define **what** the program does without concerning themselves with **how** tasks are performed.
- Are concerned with the **policy** or **rules** of the application.
