### **What Does `JOIN` Do?**

The `JOIN` keyword is used to combine two or more tables in a **single result set**. It allows you to retrieve data from multiple tables based on a **relationship** between them.

- **In simple terms**: A `JOIN` combines rows from different tables into one table based on [[Common columns]].

### **What Does `ON` Do?**

The `ON` keyword specifies the **condition** (or **rule**) that determines how the rows from the two tables should be matched. It is used to tell SQL which columns to use as the "link" between the tables.

- **In simple terms**: The `ON` condition tells SQL how to match the data from one table with data in another table.
