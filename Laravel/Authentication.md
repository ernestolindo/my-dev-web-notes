`sanctum` is going to authenticate the user with a [[Token-based authentication system]]
Laravel Sanctum isÂ **an authentication system for basic token-based APIs**.

When we consume an API there are two parts:
- frontend
- backend

They interact through an URL.

Our data does not get exposed.

The tokens are stored in the table `personal_access_tokens` When we log out, we must delete all the tokens associated with an user.
