Laravel is a PHP web framework that is designed to make it easier to develop modern web applications. One of its core principles is adherence to the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architectural pattern.

Laravel Migration isÂ **a set of instructions that define the changes you want to make to your database schema**. These changes can include creating new tables, altering existing tables, adding or modifying columns, and seeding the database with initial data.

```powershell
php artisan make:model Name -mcr
```
