# **Node Package Manager**

The **Node Package Manager (npm)** is a tool that helps developers manage and install libraries or packages for their projects. It comes with **[[Node.js]]** and allows you to easily download, update, and manage dependencies (like JavaScript libraries or tools) needed for your application. npm also provides a way to automate tasks and share your own packages with others.

npm interacts with **[[package.json]]** and **`package-lock.json`** to handle dependencies.
