# **Low-level module**

A [[Module]] is a self-contained part of a program that performs a specific task or set of tasks. In object-oriented programming a module could be a class or a set of related classes.

Low-level modules:

- Represent the **detailed implementations** that support high-level modules.
- Perform specific tasks such as **data storage**, **network communication**, or **file operations**.
- Are concerned with the **mechanics** of how something is done.
