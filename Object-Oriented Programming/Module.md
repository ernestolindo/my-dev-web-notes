# **Module**

A module in a software system isÂ ==a section of code that defines a specific function within a program==, i.e. an extension to the main program dedicated to specific functions, allowing for organized and manageable code development. A class in an object-oriented language is an example of module.

A [[High-level module]] is a module (class) that uses other modules (classes) to perform a task. A [[Low-level module]] contains a detailed implementation of some specific task that can be used by other modules.
