# **Scope Resolution Operator**

The **scope resolution operator** (`::`) is called so because it is used to **resolve the scope** of class members (such as static properties, constants, or methods). Essentially, it determines the **context (scope)** in which a class member is being accessed or referenced.

The operator `::` explicitly tells PHP which class to look at when accessing a member. This is particularly important when:

- Working with **static members**.
- Referencing **constants**.
- Differentiating between a **parent class** and a **child class** in inheritance.
