# **Preprocessor Scripting Language**

A **preprocessor scripting language** is a tool that processes code before it is sent to the main compiler or interpreter. For beginners, this concept often comes up in contexts like web development or programming environments where repetitive tasks can be simplified.

Preprocessor Scripting Languages:
- SASS/SCSS (CSS Preprocessor)
- Pug (HTML Preprocessor)
- TypeScript (JavaScript Preprocessor)
- Markdown (Preprocessor for Text to HTML)
