2. **Understanding XML**: XML (Extensible Markup Language) is explained as a markup language, not a programming language. It describes data in a human-readable format and allows for customization in various contexts, including web data transmission.
    
3. **Key Takeaway**: XML files, particularly layout files, provide structured instructions for the Android system to render the user interface.
