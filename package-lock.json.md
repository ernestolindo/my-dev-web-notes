# **package-lock.json**

The **`package-lock.json`** file is automatically created by npm when you install or update packages in your project. It records the exact versions of all the packages (and their dependencies) that were installed, ensuring that everyone working on the project installs the **same versions** of these packages. This helps avoid issues where different environments or developers might use different versions of the same package, leading to potential errors or inconsistencies.

In simple terms, **`package-lock.json`** locks down the versions of the packages to make sure the project works the same way for everyone.

If another developer clones your project and runs `npm install`, npm will use **`package-lock.json`** to install the exact versions of the dependencies, ensuring **everyone's environment is the same**.
