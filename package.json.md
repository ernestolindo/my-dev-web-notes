# **package.json**

The **`package.json`** file is a special file in a Node.js project that contains important information about the project, such as its name, version, and the list of libraries or [[Packages]] (called **dependencies**) that the project needs to run. It also includes scripts to automate tasks, like starting the project or running tests.

In simple terms, the **`package.json`** file helps manage the project's setup and keeps track of what tools and packages are needed to make the project work.

- **`package.json`** is where you define your projectâ€™s metadata and the **dependencies** it needs to function.
- In **`package.json`**, you specify the names and version ranges of the packages (e.g., `"sass": "^1.32.0"`) that your project relies on.
- When you run `npm install`, npm checks the `package.json` to see which dependencies to install.
